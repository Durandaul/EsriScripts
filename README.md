# EsriScripts
Scripts to assist users of ESRI's ArcMap, ArcGIS

An issue we've been running into for a client was lock files have a strong tendenacy to be left behind after data migrations. This is a very easy way on windows to find and remove files. 

Notes:
1) It is intentionally simplisitc. I'll try to add this to get better as a programmer but it's honestly intended to be a simple tool
2) It's windows specific. You can do this on *Nix pretty easily anyways ;)
3) I made an esri parser to parse lock files but it's not implemented in the current commandline usage
